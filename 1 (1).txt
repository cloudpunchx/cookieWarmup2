WARMUP:

1. Create a folder called CookieWarmupTwo, connect to Git/GitHub
2. In the folder, create the files index.html, display.html, app.js & display.js.
  2.1. Link them together and ensure both pages have the Cookies script tag
3. Configure the debugger
4. Using JS, insert 3 images into the index.html
5. Using JS, add an event listener to each image inserted
  5.1 Note, this means you will need to select those images from the page after you insert all 3
6. When an image is clicked, store its image src into a cookie called `image_url`.

7. On the display page, show the image that was clicked.
